    <p><i>It's <u>no secret</u> that America has a gun violence issue.</i> </p>
      <p>Incidents like the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Sandy-Hook-Elementary-School-shooting">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-respond-shooting-parkland-florida-high-school-n848101">Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School</a> massacres, along with the most recent <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/series/uvalde-texas-school-shooting/">Robb Elementary School</a> shooting have sparked a national conversation about gun law restrictions. </p>
      <p> Oddly enough, a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/">Pew Research survey</a> concluded that Americans are torn over whether restricting legal gun ownership would lead to fewer mass shootings. <i>49%</i> of adults say there would be fewer mass shootings if it was more of hassle to legally own a gun, <i>42%</i> of adults believe it wouldn't make a difference and <i>9%</i> of adults thin there would be more mass shootings. <b>But, what about the countless children and young people killed by gun violence every day?</b></p>

 <p>As reported by CBS News, Darius Lee was a promising college basketball athlete who was gunned down in Harlem in June 2022. Family members described him as "humble, quiet, star, amazing." The star athlete received a full ride to Houston Baptist University and was slated to graduate Dec. 2022; instead, his family had to bury him.</p>

        <h4>Gun violence</h4>
        <p style="padding:10px; border: 2px"> At least <b>40 children and teenagers have been shot in 2022 </b>, making up about one in every 10 victims. The number is on track to match or exceed the number of youth victims last year, when 138 were struck by bullets," as reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/nyregion/nyc-gun-violence-children.html">The NY Times.</a></p>

        <h4>Mental Health</h4>
        <p>Psychological expert James Garbarino, PhD, found that <b>young people in rough neighborhoods rarely receive substantial <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2209422">mental health support</a></b> — most essentially, trauma-informed psychotherapy — as they undergo post-traumatic stress development.</p> 

          <p>Young people who experience gun-violence are likely to develop a range of problems as a result of experiencing and normalizing gun-violence–related trauma.</p>

        <h4>Death at young ages</h4>
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/gun-violence-is-having-a-devastating-impact-on-young-people/">The Center for American Progress</a>, due to an increase in gun homicides among children and teenagers during 2020, <b>gun deaths have exceeded vehicle-related deaths</b> as the leading cause of death for Americans ages 1 to 17.</p>

        <p>While 2,159 children and teenagers died in vehicle-related accidents in 2020, 2,270 were killed with a gun that year.</p>

        <h4>Community impact</h4>
        <p>Gun violence is severly affecting young people in the Black and Hispanic communities. CDC <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/frequently-asked-questions-about-community-based-violence-intervention-programs/">gun homicide data</a> from 2016-2020 shows <b>young Hispanics represented 4% of the population, but they suffered 8% of gun homicides.</b>
